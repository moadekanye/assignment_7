The Random Forest Regressor performed the best, with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2480.67 and the highest R² score of 0.57. This model effectively captures complex patterns in the data, allowing it to make better predictions.

In comparison, the Linear Regression model struggled with non-linear relationships, resulting in a higher MSE. The Decision Tree Regressor didn’t perform as well either, likely due to overfitting. Overall, the Random Forest model is the strongest choice for predicting diabetes progression, thanks to its ability to balance complexity and accuracy.

This project aims to use machine learning to predict diabetes progression based on clinical data. I implemented three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, using the Scikit Learn library. The main parts of the project include the input features (X), the target variable (y), and the training and testing datasets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test). The diabetes dataset is loaded and inputed, split into training and testing sets, trained each model, made predictions, and evaluated their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. Some limitations include the small size of the dataset, which may limit how well the models perform on new data, and the complexity of the Random Forest model, which requires more computational power.
